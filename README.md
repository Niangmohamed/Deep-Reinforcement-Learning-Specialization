# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Specialization

Here you can find several projects dedicated to the Deep Reinforcement Learning methods.

These projects are developed as part of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program. Several projects are devoted to Deep Reinforcement Learning Architectures, Value-Based Methods and Bellman Equation, Policy-Based Methods, Policy-Gradient Methods and Actor-Critic Methods.

> Monte-Carlo Methods

In Monte Carlo (MC), we play episodes of the game until we reach the end, we grab the rewards collected on the way and move backward to the start of the episode. We repeat this method a sufficient number of times and we average the value of each state.

> Temporal Difference Methods and Q-learning

> Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Space (Deep Q-Network)

> Function Approximation and Neural Network

The Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) states that feed-forward neural networks containing a
single hidden layer with a finite number of nodes can be used to approximate any continuous function provided rather mild assumptions about the form of the activation function are satisfied.

> Policy-Based Methods, Hill Climbing, Simulating Annealing

Random-restart hill climbing is a surprisingly effective algorithm in many cases. Simulated annealing is a good probabilistic technique because it does not accidentally think a local extrema is a global extrema.

> Policy-Gradient Methods, REINFORCE, PPO

Define a performance measure J(theta) to maximaze. Learn policy paramter theta throgh approximate gradient ascent.

> Actor-Critic Methods, A3C, A2C, DDPG, TD3, SAC

The key difference from A2C is the Asynchronous part. A3C consists of multiple independent agents (networks) with their own weights, who interact with a different copy of the environment in parallel. Thus, they can explore a bigger part of the state-action space in much less time.
